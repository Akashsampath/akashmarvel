# Task 1
## 3D Printing
<p> 3D printing uses computer-aided design to create three-dimensional objects through a layering method. 
            Sometimes referred to as additive manufacturing, 3D printing involves layering materials, like plastics, 
            composites or bio-materials to create objects that range in shape, size, rigidity and color.</p>

### *HOW DOES A 3D PRINTER WORK:*
* Picture a robot-controlled hot glue gun that uses plastic instead of glue, and you have the basics of a 3D printer. 
* Strands of plastic are fed into a print head, which is heated up to melt the material. 
* The print head moves around very precisely in three dimensions and drops lines of plastic onto the print bed—the table on which it prints. 
* The printer does this over and over, building up layers of plastic until it forms a 3D part.

### *STL FILES :*
<p> STL is a file format native to the stereolithography CAD software created by 3D Systems. STL has several backronyms such as "Standard Triangle Language" and "Standard Tessellation Language" </p>

###  *SLICING :*
<p> Slicing is the process of breaking down a 3D model into thousands of horizontal layers, which can then be printed one layer at a time. </p>

### TERMS USED IN 3D PRINTING:
1. BED TEMPERATURE
1. INFILL DENSITY
1. NOZZLE TEMPERATURE

### *BED TEMPERATURE:*
For FDM 3D printing materials generally, a heated bed provides some important benefits. Firstly, it helps with bed adhesion. When the print bed is hotter than the ambient temperature, it allows the first layer of extruded filament to stay soft for longer, giving more time for first-layer adhesion to take place.

### *INFILL DENSITY:*
Infill density is a percentage value that determines the amount of plastic that fills the model you print. As the infill density value gets bigger, the model becomes heavier and stronger due to the increased amount of plastic in it.

### *NOZZLE TEMPERATURE:*
nozzle temperature comes into action, for it is the final piece of the printing machine through which the material passes before it is incorporated in the final build, and also because this nozzle is responsible for heating the material to its optimal temperature.

# TASK 2
## SOLDERING PREREQUISTIES
Soldering  is a process of joining two metal surfaces together using a filler metal called solder. The soldering process involves heating the surfaces to be joined and melting the solder, which is then allowed to cool and solidify, creating a strong and durable joint.

![Soldering materials](https://www.sciencebuddies.org/Files/532/8/Elec_primer-solder1.jpg)

### *SOLDERING IRON :*
A soldering iron is a hand tool used in soldering. It supplies heat to melt solder so that it can flow into the joint between two workpieces.
### *SOLDERING FLUX:*
 is a chemical cleaning agent, flowing agent, or purifying agent. Fluxes may have more than one function at a time. They are used in both extractive metallurgy and metal joining.
 ### *SOLDERING WICK:*
 desoldering is the removal of solder and components from a circuit board for troubleshooting, repair, replacement, and salvage.

 # TASK 3
 ## *DESIGN A 555 ASTABLE MULTIVIBRATOR WITH 60% DUTY CYCLE*
## WHAT IS AN ASTABLE MULTIVIBRATOR?
 * Astable Multivibrators are free running oscillators which oscillate between two states continually producing two square wave output waveforms.
* Astable multivibrators are also known as Free-running Multivibrator as they do not require any additional inputs or external assistance to oscillate. Astable oscillators produce a continuous square wave from its output or outputs, (two outputs no inputs) which can then be used to flash lights or produce a sound in a loudspeaker.

## *DESIGNING A ASTABLE MULTIVIBRATOR:*

t1 – capacitor charge “ON” time is calculated as:

# TASK 5
## *TINKERCAD*
Create a tinkercad account, get familiar with the application, understand the example circuits
given and simulate the following using ultrasonic/infrared sensors, estimate the distance
between an obstacle and the sensor. Display the results on a LCD screen.

### *ULTRASONIC SENSOR*
* Ultrasonic sensors are electronic devices that calculate the target’s distance by emission of ultrasonic sound waves and convert those waves into electrical signals. The speed of emitted ultrasonic waves traveling speed is faster than the audible sound.
### *INFRARED SENSOR*
* An infrared (IR) sensor is an electronic device that measures and detects infrared radiation in its surrounding environment. 
* Infrared radiation was accidentally discovered by an astronomer named William Herchel in 1800. While measuring the temperature of each color of light (separated by a prism), he noticed that the temperature just beyond the red light was highest.
* IR is invisible to the human eye, as its wavelength is longer than that of visible light (though it is still on the same electromagnetic spectrum).
 * Anything that emits heat (everything that has a temperature above around five degrees Kelvin) gives off infrared radiation.

# TASK 7
## *Karnaugh Maps and Deriving the logic circuit*
Description: For 4 cases, based on door lock/open and key pressed/not pressed. Determine the
karnaugh map and make a burglar alarm using simple logic circuits. The buzzer or led blinks

## WHAT IS KARNAUGH MAP:
* In many digital circuits and practical problems we need to find expression with minimum variables.
* We can minimize Boolean expressions of 3, 4 variables very easily using K-map without using any Boolean algebra theorems. K-map can take two forms Sum of Product (SOP) and Product of Sum (POS) according to the need of problem.

## *Steps to solve expression using K-map:*

* Identify minterms or maxterms as given in problem.
* For SOP put 1’s in blocks of K-map respective to the minterms (0’s elsewhere).
